### Prequisites
- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows)
  - A couple testers had issues running the JAR file with only Java installed so I'm linking the JDK
  - I believe this should work with only Java installed, but maybe I built the JAR wrong

### Instructions
 - Download and launch pkStadiumRandomizer.jar
 - Enter the path to your game
   - C:\File\Path\game.z64
 - Enter the path to the folder you want to store the seed in
   - C:\File\Path\pkSeeds
 - The ROM and destination folder can each be dragged and dropped into their respective fields, which should populate the paths for you
 - "PKseed.z64" will be created in the destination folder should the application run successfully

### Bug Reporting
 - Please send an email to jcostello711@gmail.com with "[Pokemon Stadium Randomizer Bug]" somewhere in the subject
